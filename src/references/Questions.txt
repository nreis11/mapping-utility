1. Should I be using a JS object to store my tree data or use an array?
It's probably best to keep as array because when imported, a tree is created with children arrays inside nodes.

2. What makes more sense? 
Save mapping path using tree indices or using the keys
If I save the keys, I need to relocate the mapped node to display the title, but in the export,
I don't need to use a lookup to retrive the keys


Features to add
- When find prompt triggered (CTRL - F), autocomplete field with Internal Node Label

Logic
- User selects node in each tree
  - Get active node
- User maps ext node to int node
  - Get active ext node and add mapping to int
- Next child in int tree becomes active node
- User exports mapping
